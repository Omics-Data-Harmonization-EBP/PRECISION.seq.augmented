Description:The PRECISION.seq.augmented R package offers a comprehensive 
    framework for evaluating depth normalization methods in microRNA sequencing 
    data analysis. It allows investigating normalization performance in both 
    clustering and classification contexts and provides researchers with tools 
    to assess how different normalization approaches affect analytical outcomes. 
    Using AI-augmented miRNA-seq data derived from paired benchmark and test 
    datasets, the package enables systematic comparison across controlled 
    conditions with varying biological signal strengths and technical artifact
    magnitudes. PRECISION.seq.augmented implements multiple normalization 
    techniques, clustering approaches, and classification algorithms, allowing 
    researchers to identify optimal strategies for their specific analytical 
    needs and reproduce findings from our publications. This package represents 
    an essential resource for researchers seeking to maximize the reliability 
    and reproducibility of insights derived from miRNA sequencing data.
