\title{Load augmented data from GitHub (with integrity check)}
\usage{
load.augmented.data(temp = FALSE, force.redownload = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{temp}{Logical. If TRUE, store file in temporary directory.
Default is FALSE (persistent storage).}

\item{force.redownload}{Logical. If TRUE, force re-download even if file
exists and passes integrity check.}
}
\value{
The loaded R object, which is a list containing the augmented
benchmark and test datasets.
}
\description{
This function loads the augmented dataset. If the dataset was not previously downloaded,
it will download it from the package GitHub release.
It checks the integrity of the downloaded file using SHA256 hash to ensure
the file is not corrupted or tampered with.
It supports both persistent storage in the user's R data directory and
temporary (R-session) storage.
The temporary storage is useful for testing purposes or when you do not want
to keep the data after the R session ends.
To delete the cached data, use the \code{\link{cleanup.augmented.data}} function.
This function also allows for re-downloading the file even if it exists,
based on the `force.redownload` parameter.
\code{load.augmented.data()} returns the loaded R object, which is a list
containing the augmented benchmark and test datasets.

\dontrun{
# First-time load: downloads & caches
augmented.data <- load.augmented.data()

# Uses cached file if valid
augmented.data <- load.augmented.data()

# Force re-download
augmented.data <- load.augmented.data(force = TRUE)

# Store in tempdir() instead of persistent
augmented.data <- load.augmented.data(temp = TRUE)

# Access benchmark and test datasets
benchmark <- augmented.data$benchmark
test <- augmented.data$test

# Cleanup both locations and remove cached data
cleanup.augmented.data()
