\title{Add biological effects to benchmark data}
\usage{
biological.effects(benchmark, group, c)
}
\arguments{
\item{benchmark}{Numeric matrix of expression values, (\code{p} by \code{n}), where
\code{p} is the number of features and \code{n} is the number of samples.}

\item{group}{Factor or vector of character strings defining sample groups
for each sample. Must have exactly two levels.}

\item{c}{Numeric amplification factor}
}
\value{
List containing modified data, group information, and amplification factor.
}
\description{
This function simulates biological effects on benchmark data by amplifying
the signal between \emph{two} groups based on a specified amplification factor.
It modifies the input data and returns the amplified data along with group information.
