# MiRNA Sequencing Test Data

Myxofibrosarcoma (MXF) and pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma
(PMFH) are the two most common and aggressive subtypes of genetically
complex soft tissue sarcoma. MiRNAs for the same 54 tumors used for the
benchmark data were re-sequenced using neither uniform handling nor
balanced library assignment. In this study these samples were sequenced
in the order of sample collection and processed in multiple runs.

## Usage

``` r
data.test
```

## Format

A dataframe with 1033 rows and 54 columns. Here are the examples of the
column and row naming rule:

- MXF2516:

  One sample belonging to MXF sample ID MXF2516.

- hsa-let-7a-2\*:

  Gene ID.
